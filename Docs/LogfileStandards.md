# Logfile Standards and Conventions

## Description
This document defines the standards and conventions for logfile creation and usage within this project. All logfiles generated by scripts should follow a consistent structure to ensure clarity, ease of parsing, and effective troubleshooting. Logfiles are a critical resource for both human maintainers and AI agents, providing a reliable audit trail of script execution, error handling, and data processing. The guidelines here are designed to maximize the utility of logs for automated analysis and debugging, while also keeping them readable and concise for manual review.

Each logfile must be named after the script that generates it, with a `.log` extension, and stored in the `log/` directory. Logfiles should begin with a session header that includes the full date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time of session start. For each iteration over MVAs (Motor Vehicle Assignments), a clear MVA header must be logged, marking the start of processing for that MVA. This header should be visually distinct (e.g., a line of asterisks or similar) and include the MVA identifier. To conserve line space, individual log entries should omit the date, showing only the time; the date should appear only in the session header. This approach ensures that logs remain compact while retaining all necessary context for each session.

## Logfile Patterns and Requirements
- **Naming**: Each logfile must be named after its script (e.g., `GlassDataParser.log`) and placed in the `log/` directory.
- **Session Header**: At the start of each logfile, include a header with the session's full date and time.
- **MVA Headers**: For every MVA processed, insert a visually distinct header (e.g., a line of asterisks and the MVA number) to clearly delineate log sections.
- **Timestamping**: Only the time (HH:MM:SS) should be included in individual log entries; the date is reserved for the session header.
- **Consistency**: All scripts must use the same logging format and conventions to facilitate automated log analysis and cross-script debugging.
- **Audience**: These conventions are designed for AI agents and automated tools, ensuring logs are easy to parse, segment, and interpret programmatically.
